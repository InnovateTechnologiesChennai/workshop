what is html ?

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes to describe elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia content. HTML provides the foundation for building websites and is typically used alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML documents are interpreted by web browsers to render the content and display it to users on the internet

Heading tags :

HTML are used to define headings and subheadings within a document. They range from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the highest level (most important) heading and <h6> being the lowest level (least important) heading. Here's how they are typically used:

<h1>: Denotes the main heading of the page. There should ideally be only one <h1> tag per page, representing the primary topic or subject matter.
<h2> to <h6>: Used for subheadings or sections within the document. The level of importance decreases as the number in the tag increases. For example, <h2> is a subsection of <h1>, <h3> is a subsection of <h2>, and so on.

    <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>
    <h2>This is an h2 heading</h2>
    <h3>This is an h3 heading</h3>
    <h4>This is an h4 heading</h4>
    <h5>This is an h5 heading</h5>
    <h6>This is an h6 heading</h6>

Paragraph tag :

HTML are represented by the <p> element and are used to define paragraphs of text within a web page. They are one of the fundamental block-level elements in HTML. Paragraph tags are used to separate blocks of text and provide structure to the content. Here's an example of how paragraph tags are used in HTML:

<p>This is the first paragraph of text. It contains some information about a topic.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph. It provides additional details related to the topic discussed in the first paragraph.</p>

Anchor Tag :

The <a> tag in HTML is used to create hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages or resources. Here's how the <a> tag is typically structured:

<a href="https://www.jiocinema.com/" target="_blank">Go to Jio Cinema</a>

List tags : 

<ol> and <ul> are HTML elements used to create ordered and unordered lists, respectively.

<ol> stands for "ordered list." It is used to create a list where the items are numbered sequentially. Each item within an <ol> element is defined using the <li> (list item) tag.

<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ol>

<ul> stands for "unordered list." It is used to create a list where the items are bulleted or marked with some other symbol. Like <ol>, each item within a <ul> element is defined using the <li> tag.


<ul>
    <li>Red</li>
    <li>Green</li>
    <li>Blue</li>
</ul>
