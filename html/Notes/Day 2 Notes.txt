Image Tag : 

In HTML, the <img> tag is used to embed images into a web page. Here's how you typically use it:

src: Specifies the URL of the image. It can be a relative or absolute URL.
alt: Provides an alternative text for the image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded or by screen readers for visually impaired users.
width: Specifies the width of the image in pixels. This attribute is optional and can be omitted if you want to maintain the image's original width.
height: Specifies the height of the image in pixels. Similarly, this attribute is optional and can be omitted to maintain the image's original height.

hr: Stands for "horizontal rule." It inserts a horizontal line or rule across the webpage, typically used to separate content into sections or to mark a thematic break between different parts of the page. It's a self-closing tag and doesn't require a closing tag.

Table Tags:

<tr>: Defines a table row.
<th>: Defines a table header cell. Typically used for headings at the top of columns or rows.
<td>: Defines a table data cell. Contains data or content within a table.

Rowspan: This attribute defines the number of rows a cell should span vertically. It allows a cell to occupy multiple rows in a table. When applied, the cell merges with the specified number of rows below it.

For example, if a cell has rowspan="2", it spans across two rows, effectively occupying the space of two cells vertically. The content of the cell is displayed in the first row, and the remaining space in the second row is left empty.

Colspan: This attribute defines the number of columns a cell should span horizontally. It allows a cell to occupy multiple columns in a table. When applied, the cell merges with the specified number of columns to its right.

For instance, if a cell has colspan="3", it spans across three columns, effectively occupying the space of three cells horizontally. The content of the cell is displayed in the first column, and the remaining space in the second and third columns is left empty.
