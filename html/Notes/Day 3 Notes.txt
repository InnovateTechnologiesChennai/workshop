In HTML, the ampersand character (&) is used to begin an entity reference, which is a code that represents a special character or symbol. Entity references are often used to display characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as reserved characters or characters that are difficult to type on a keyboard.

Here are some commonly used entity references in HTML:

&amp;: Represents the ampersand character itself (&). This is necessary to avoid confusion with the start of an entity reference.
&lt;: Represents the less-than symbol (<).
&gt;: Represents the greater-than symbol (>).
&quot;: Represents the double quotation mark (").
&apos;: Represents the apostrophe or single quotation mark ('). Note that some HTML specifications may not support this entity reference, so using the actual character (') is often preferred.
&nbsp;: Represents a non-breaking space. It is used to create space between words or elements that should not be broken across lines.
&copy; represents the copyright symbol (Â©).
